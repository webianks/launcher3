# Launcher3 - Gradle

This repo contains an up-to-date Launcher3, with all the goodies Google added in Marshmallow. I converted it to build with gradle so it is easy to manage. All other credit goes to the Google Team.

Feel free to fork and use this as a base project for any launchers you might want to make in the future. I will try to keep it up with the latest changes from Google.
